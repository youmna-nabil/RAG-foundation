What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an innovative approach in the field of natural language processing (NLP) that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to enhance the quality of generated text. This hybrid model aims to leverage the vast amounts of information available in large-scale databases or knowledge bases, making it particularly effective for tasks that require accurate and contextually relevant information.

The Basics of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
At its core, Retrieval-Augmented Generation involves two main components:

Retriever: This component is responsible for fetching relevant information from a large corpus or database. The retriever is typically based on models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which can effectively search and rank documents based on their relevance to the input query.
Generator: This component takes the information retrieved by the retriever and generates coherent and contextually appropriate responses. The generator is usually a transformer-based model, such as GPT-3 or T5, known for its powerful language generation capabilities.
Significance of RAG
Improved Accuracy: RAG combines the benefits of retrieval-based and generative models, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
Enhanced Contextual Understanding: By retrieving and incorporating relevant knowledge from a knowledge base, RAG demonstrates a deeper understanding of queries, resulting in more precise answers.
Reduced Bias and Misinformation: RAG’s reliance on verified knowledge sources helps mitigate bias and reduces the spread of misinformation compared to purely generative models.
Versatility: RAG can be applied to various natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, chatbots, and content generation, making it a versatile tool for language-related applications.
Empowering Human-AI Collaboration: RAG can assist humans by providing valuable insights and information, enhancing collaboration between humans and AI systems.
Advancement in AI Research: RAG represents a significant advancement in AI research by combining retrieval and generation techniques, pushing the boundaries of natural language understanding and generation.
Overall, RAG’s significance lies in its ability to improve the accuracy, relevance, and versatility of natural language processing tasks, while also addressing challenges related to bias and misinformation.

What problems does RAG solve?
The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach helps solve several challenges in natural language processing (NLP) and AI applications:

Access to Custom Data: RAG allows AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), to access and incorporate custom data specific to an organization’s domain. This enables the models to provide more relevant and accurate responses tailored to the organization’s needs.
Dynamic Adaptation: Unlike traditional LLMs that are static once trained, RAG models can dynamically adapt to new data and information, reducing the risk of providing outdated or incorrect answers.
Reduced Training Costs: RAG eliminates the need for retraining or fine-tuning LLMs for specific tasks, as it can leverage existing models and augment them with relevant data.
Improved Performance: By incorporating real-time data retrieval, RAG can enhance the performance of AI applications, such as chatbots and search engines, by providing more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
Broader Applicability: RAG can be applied to various use cases, including question answering, chatbots, search engines, and knowledge engines, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of NLP tasks.
Overall, RAG addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs by enabling them to leverage custom data, adapt to new information, and provide more relevant and accurate responses, making it an effective approach for enhancing AI applications.

Benefits of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach offers several benefits:

Up-to-date and Accurate Responses: RAG ensures responses are based on current external data sources, reducing the risk of providing outdated or incorrect information.
Reduced Inaccuracies and Hallucinations: By grounding responses in relevant external knowledge, RAG helps mitigate the risk of generating inaccurate or fabricated information, known as hallucinations.
Domain-specific and Relevant Responses: RAG allows models to provide contextually relevant responses tailored to an organization’s proprietary or domain-specific data, improving the quality of the answers.
Efficiency and Cost-effectiveness: RAG is a simple and cost-effective way to customize LLMs with domain-specific data, as it does not require extensive model customization or fine-tuning.
As for when to use RAG versus fine-tuning the model, RAG is a good starting point and may be entirely sufficient for some use cases. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, is more suitable when you need the LLM to learn a different “language” or “behavior”. These approaches are not mutually exclusive, and you can use fine-tuning to improve the model’s understanding.

Challenges and Future Directions
Despite its advantages, RAG faces several challenges:

Complexity: Combining retrieval and generation adds complexity to the model, requiring careful tuning and optimization to ensure both components work seamlessly together.
Latency: The retrieval step can introduce latency, making it challenging to deploy RAG models in real-time applications.
Quality of Retrieval: The overall performance of RAG heavily depends on the quality of the retrieved documents. Poor retrieval can lead to suboptimal generation, undermining the model’s effectiveness.
Bias and Fairness: Like other AI models, RAG can inherit biases present in the training data or retrieved documents, necessitating ongoing efforts to ensure fairness and mitigate biases.
RAG Applications with Examples
Here are some examples to illustrate the applications of RAG we discussed earlier:

1. Advanced Question-Answering System
Scenario: Imagine a customer support chatbot for an online store. A customer asks, “What is the return policy for a damaged item?”
RAG in Action: The chatbot retrieves the store’s return policy document from its knowledge base. RAG then uses this information to generate a clear and concise answer like, “If your item is damaged upon arrival, you can return it free of charge within 30 days of purchase. Please visit our returns page for detailed instructions.”
2. Content Creation and Summarization
Scenario: You’re building a travel website and want to create a summary of the Great Barrier Reef.
RAG in Action: RAG can access and process vast amounts of information about the Great Barrier Reef from various sources. It can then provide a concise summary highlighting key points like its location, size, biodiversity, and conservation efforts.
3. Conversational Agents and Chatbots
Scenario: A virtual assistant for a financial institution. A user asks, “What are some factors to consider when choosing a retirement plan?”
RAG in Action: The virtual assistant retrieves relevant information about retirement plans and investment strategies. RAG then uses this knowledge to provide the user with personalized guidance based on their age, income, and risk tolerance.
4. Information Retrieval
Scenario: You’re searching the web for information about the history of artificial intelligence (AI).
RAG in Action: A RAG-powered search engine can not only return relevant webpages but also generate informative snippets that summarize the content of each page. This allows you to quickly grasp the key points of each result without having to visit every single webpage.
5. Educational Tools and Resources
Scenario: An online learning platform for science courses. A student is studying about the human body and has a question about the function of the heart.
RAG in Action: The platform uses RAG to access relevant information about the heart’s anatomy and function from the course materials. It then presents the student with an explanation, diagrams, and perhaps even links to video resources, all tailored to their specific learning needs.
Example Scenario: AI Chatbot for Medical Information
Imagine a scenario where a person is experiencing symptoms of an illness and seeks information from an AI chatbot. Traditionally, the AI would rely solely on its training data to respond, potentially leading to inaccurate or incomplete information. However, with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, the AI can provide more accurate and reliable answers by incorporating knowledge from trustworthy medical sources.

Step-by-Step Process of RAG in Action
Retrieval Stage: The RAG system accesses a vast medical knowledge base, including textbooks, research papers, and reputable health websites. It searches this database to find relevant information related to the queried medical condition’s symptoms. Using advanced techniques, the system identifies and retrieves passages that contain useful information.
Generation Stage: With the retrieved knowledge, the RAG system generates a response that includes factual information about the symptoms of the medical condition. The generative model processes the retrieved passages along with the user query to craft a coherent and contextually relevant response. The response may include a list of common symptoms associated with the queried medical condition, along with additional context or explanations to help the user understand the information better.
In this example, RAG enhances the AI chatbot’s ability to provide accurate and reliable information about medical symptoms by leveraging external knowledge sources. This approach improves the user experience and ensures that the information provided is trustworthy and up-to-date.

An ‘open book’ approach to answering tough questions
Underpinning all foundation models, including LLMs, is an AI architecture known as the transformer. It turns heaps of raw data into a compressed representation of its basic structure. Starting from this raw representation, a foundation model can be adapted to a variety of tasks with some additional fine-tuning on labeled, domain-specific knowledge.

But fine-tuning alone rarely gives the model the full breadth of knowledge it needs to answer highly specific questions in an ever-changing context. In a 2020 paper, Meta (then known as Facebook) came up with a framework called retrieval-augmented generation to give LLMs access to information beyond their training data. RAG allows LLMs to build on a specialized body of knowledge to answer questions in more accurate way.

“It’s the difference between an open-book and a closed-book exam,” Lastras said. “In a RAG system, you are asking the model to respond to a question by browsing through the content in a book, as opposed to trying to remember facts from memory.”

As the name suggests, RAG has two phases: retrieval and content generation. In the retrieval phase, algorithms search for and retrieve snippets of information relevant to the user’s prompt or question. In an open-domain, consumer setting, those facts can come from indexed documents on the internet; in a closed-domain, enterprise setting, a narrower set of sources are typically used for added security and reliability.

This assortment of external knowledge is appended to the user’s prompt and passed to the language model. In the generative phase, the LLM draws from the augmented prompt and its internal representation of its training data to synthesize an engaging answer tailored to the user in that instant. The answer can then be passed to a chatbot with links to its sources.

Toward personalized and verifiable responses
Before LLMs, digital conversation agents followed a manual dialogue flow. They confirmed the customer’s intent, fetched the requested information, and delivered an answer in a one-size-fits all script. For straightforward queries, this manual decision-tree method worked just fine.

But it had limitations. Anticipating and scripting answers to every question a customer might conceivably ask took time; if you missed a scenario, the chatbot had no ability to improvise. Updating the scripts as policies and circumstances evolved was either impractical or impossible.

Today, LLM-powered chatbots can give customers more personalized answers without humans having to write out new scripts. And RAG allows LLMs to go one step further by greatly reducing the need to feed and retrain the model on fresh examples. Simply upload the latest documents or policies, and the model retrieves the information in open-book mode to answer the question.

IBM is currently using RAG to ground its internal customer-care chatbots on content that can be verified and trusted. This real-world scenario shows how it works: An employee, Alice, has learned that her son’s school will have early dismissal on Wednesdays for the rest of the year. She wants to know if she can take vacation in half-day increments and if she has enough vacation to finish the year.

To craft its response, the LLM first pulls data from Alice’s HR files to find out how much vacation she gets as a longtime employee, and how many days she has left for the year. It also searches the company’s policies to verify that her vacation can be taken in half-days. These facts are injected into Alice’s initial query and passed to the LLM, which generates a concise, personalized answer. A chatbot delivers the response, with links to its sources.

Teaching the model to recognize when it doesn’t know
Customer queries aren’t always this straightforward. They can be ambiguously worded, complex, or require knowledge the model either doesn’t have or can’t easily parse. These are the conditions in which LLMs are prone to making things up.

“Think of the model as an overeager junior employee that blurts out an answer before checking the facts,” said Lastras. “Experience teaches us to stop and say when we don’t know something. But LLMs need to be explicitly trained to recognize questions they can’t answer.”

In a more challenging scenario taken from real life, Alice wants to know how many days of maternity leave she gets. A chatbot that does not use RAG responds cheerfully (and incorrectly): “Take as long as you want.”

Maternity-leave policies are complex, in part, because they vary by the state or country of the employee’s home-office. When the LLM failed to find a precise answer, it should have responded, “I’m sorry, I don’t know,” said Lastras, or asked additional questions until it could land on a question it could definitively answer. Instead, it pulled a phrase from a training set stocked with empathetic, customer-pleasing language.

With enough fine-tuning, an LLM can be trained to pause and say when it’s stuck. But it may need to see thousands of examples of questions that can and can’t be answered. Only then can the model learn to identify an unanswerable question, and probe for more detail until it hits on a question that it has the information to answer.

RAG is currently the best-known tool for grounding LLMs on the latest, verifiable information, and lowering the costs of having to constantly retrain and update them. RAG depends on the ability to enrich prompts with relevant information contained in vectors, which are mathematical representations of data. Vector databases can efficiently index, store and retrieve information for things like recommendation engines and chatbots. But RAG is imperfect, and many interesting challenges remain in getting RAG done right.

At IBM Research, we are focused on innovating at both ends of the process: retrieval, how to find and fetch the most relevant information possible to feed the LLM; and generation, how to best structure that information to get the richest responses from the LLM.
